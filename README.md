**Introduction:**

As students here at UCSD, weâ€™ve noticed that there is a distinct lack of a source that we can get all our event information from. Official events are shown on the UCSD Events Insider page, but other events, including some student run organizations, often do a lot of their advertising through social media or by handing out flyers. Because of this, it can be hard to hear about certain events, and you might miss an event you would have wanted to attend. 

You See Events aims to solve this problem by presenting all of the events on campus in one centralized location. It obtains information from the official event page for UCSD, the UCSD Events Insider page, and presents it in a user friendly format. Furthermore, individual organizations that are not popular enough to have their events listed on the UCSD Events Insider page will also be able to have their events viewed by students across campus through our app. Students will be able to use our app in order to search for events that they have in mind, or discover new events that they had no idea existed. We hope our app can help to promote event participation and lead to a more socially active campus.
